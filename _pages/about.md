I'm currently studying an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering at [Universidad de La Sabana](https://www.unisabana.edu.co/). I'm really interested in building my career around the aerospace industry. I was born  and currently living in [Bogota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1), [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia ). Leader of electronics for my hometown [university team](https://www.instagram.com/uhev.col/) participating in [Shell Eco-Marathon](https://www.makethefuture.shell/en-gb/shell-eco-marathon). Instrumentation Head for [Project Polaris](http://www.arexcr.com/projects/polaris/). You can find out more about my participation in those projects going to [`/projects`](/projects).

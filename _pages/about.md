I'm a senior mechanical engineering student at [Universidad de La Sabana](https://www.unisabana.edu.co/). I was born  and currently living in [Bogota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1), [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia ). I am a natural leader with the ability to integrate mechanical and electronic approaches to create innovative solutions. With extensive experience working on microcontroller-based projects and leading large international teams, I am a proactive self-starter who is always eager to learn new concepts. My adaptable nature combined with my attentive learning style allows me to quickly adjust to new environments.

Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects that have required me to design, prototype, and test mechanical systems with embedded microcontrollers. From designing and building an an ultra efficient electric vehicle participating in [Shell Eco-Marathon](https://www.makethefuture.shell/en-gb/shell-eco-marathon). To being part of a large international [student-led project](http://www.arexcr.com/projects/polaris/) which constructed a prototype of a Titan buoyant rover in under 21 business days. I have been able to employ mechanical and electronic concepts to create innovative solutions.

## Summary

### What

As final project of the the course **Machine Dynamics**, we were tasked by [Solvitec](https://www.solvitec.com.co), a local company, to redesign one of their glass tilting tables. The objective of the project was to eliminate the need for pneumatic cylinders in the operation of the machine. These tables are typically used in the glass industry to tilt and move heavy glass.

### How

We employed a combination of theoretical concepts in mechanical design and **Autodesk Inventor** design accelerator to develop different sections of the project, such as the 4-bar mechanism, belt selection, power transmission and cams design. We turned to **Altair Inspire** for verification and simulation.

### Results

Glass tilting table employing a 4-bar mechanism, power transmission with belts and chains, cams and motor reductors.

## Media

This is the video we created to illustrate each section of the machine. While the video is in Spanish, we included some renders at the end that showcase the machine operation.

## Final thoughts

This project provided a tremendous opportunity for me to gain valuable experience in designing and selecting various mechanical components, such as cams, chains, and belts. Through the use of technical software and the application of theoretical knowledge, I was able to design a machine that effectively combined simplicity with functionality. I am pleased with the resulting design and the high-quality work that our team produced.

Shell Eco-marathon is a global academic program focused on energy optimization and one of the world’s leading student engineering competitions which brings together STEM students from across the globe to design, build and operate some of the world’s most energy-efficient vehicles.[More infromation about the competition](https://www.makethefuture.shell/en-gb/shell-eco-marathon/faq).

I have been member of [UHEV](https://www.instagram.com/unisabanaheronsev/) (my university team) since my first semester of university in 2019 which has been participant of the competition in the electric prototype branch since 2017. I have acquire great experience involving the design, construction and test of prototypes in mechanical and electric concerns.

During my first months within the team, I learned several techniques for manufacturing carbon fiber parts as the bodywork and additional components of the vehicle are built using this material. I helped during the design of the aluminum chassis performing finite element analysis to ensure the structural integrity of the vehicle during the operation. This helped me acquire experience using CAD and CAE software such as Autodesk Inventor and Altair HyperWorks.

When I started taking electronics-focused classes, I found the combination of mechanics and electronics fascinating. I took courses on micro-controllers programming, robotics and general electronics as well as started making home projects as a hobby. Then, I became electronics leader of [UHEV](https://www.instagram.com/unisabanaheronsev/) where the main purpose is to design and build the Electronic Speed Controller for the vehicle in addition to the management and distribution of the electric battery.

As the electronics leader of the team, I have designed PCB's for the Electronic Speed Controller, selected components for its contruction as well as developed soft skills such as leadership and working under pressure.
